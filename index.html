            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>Hi! If you've come to this site you probably know me or want to know things about me! Well, that's what I'm going to write about here. Online, I go by MintyParadice, but most of my friends just call me Minty. I'm a little bit of an autistic gremlin who enjoys cute things, a little bit of chaos, and most wholesome things.</p>

                <h3>Things I do and Like:</h3>
                <p>Whether I'm online or offline, I like to explore and learn new things. So I tend to like playing games and all of that. But not watching things that are also about this. So, it's not a surprise that I like to play games like Minecraft. My other favorite thing to do is draw, so if you see little images on the site that don't look like they came from the web, it's most likely something I drew. On top of drawing, I like to record videos and capture moments of me and my friends, so for a while I've wanted to create content on the internet. Like I used to do, this is like a passion project to me, starting a YouTube channel, and possibly working in the Film industry.</p>

                <h3>My Mascots/OCs</h3>
                <p>While browsing through my page, you've probably noticed two characters floating about. Well, they are my two mascots/OC's for my channel and for myself. The one on the right of this text box is Minty. He's a little mint green fox that will represent me on streams and other non-channel content. So you'll see him most often outside of videos. The one on the left is May. She's my main channel mascot, representing my love of cute and chaotic things. She's most often in my art and on any channel-related content I make. Both are going to pop up randomly on this page so keep an eye out!</p>
